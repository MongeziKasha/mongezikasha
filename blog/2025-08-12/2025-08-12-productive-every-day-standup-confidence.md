# How I Stay Productive Every Day and Sound Confident in Standup 🚀

So, sometime last week, a Software Engineer (Grad) at my company randomly asked me to have a "coffee" chat with him. ☕

Weird.

Anyway, we sat down, and he told me he's been struggling with being productive. Which makes sense — when you're starting out, you feel like you have to Google everything just to move forward. We've all been there. Don't think you're better than him. 🤷‍♂️

<!-- truncate -->

Then he hit me with three questions:

1. 📈 How can I be productive?
2. 🎯 How do I report back with confidence in standup?
3. 👀 How do I be more visible in meetings?

Now, these sound like easy questions, right? But they're not. There's no blanket approach to this — we're all different. The same way you'd roll your eyes if someone said "all ladies/gents are the same" — yeah, it's not true. 🙄

And if you just rolled your eyes at these questions… you might be mean. You might also need to be taken to a mental institution. Society doesn't need people like you. 😤

Anyway, here's how I answered him — based on my own experience.

## 1. How I Stay Productive 📝

I keep it simple — I've got a notebook. Each page has the date at the top, and I divide it into 4 sections:

1. 🏠 **Personal Tasks**
2. 💼 **Work Tasks**  
3. 📚 **Daily Notes**
4. 🏆 **Daily Wins**

### Personal Tasks 🏠
These are things I want to get done outside of work. Could be:
- Going to the gym 💪
- Running 5km 🏃‍♂️
- Working on my personal project (yes, I make PRs my fiancée "approves" — I don't think she even reviews them 😏)

### Work Tasks 💼
Anything I need to get done for work that day. From the sprint board, meetings, or tasks I've picked up. For example:
- 10:00 AM Standup 🕙
- Create login endpoint for authentication 🔐
- Debug that weird invoice generation bug 🐛

### Daily Notes 📚
Stuff I hear in conversations, meetings, or research that's worth remembering. Makes it look like you're always on the ball. ⚽

### Daily Wins 🏆
Everything I actually accomplished that day. Seeing it written down feels good, keeps me accountable, and shows me I did get stuff done.

## Example of My Notebook Page 📖

```
Date: 12 August 2025
-----------------------------------------------
Personal Tasks:
- 6:00 AM Gym – Upper Body Day 💪
- Run 5km after work 🏃‍♂️
- Read 10 pages of "Clean Code" 📖

Work Tasks:
- 10:00 AM Standup 🕙
- Finish login endpoint for authentication 🔐
- Debug invoice generation bug (#324) 🐛
- Reject someone's PR (Joking don't cacth feeling 👀)

Daily Notes:
- Discussed API rate limits with backend team 🚀
- Learned about JWT token expiration handling 🔑
- Found a potential DB query optimization in invoice module ⚡

Daily Wins:
- Completed login endpoint & unit tests ✅
- Fixed invoice bug caused by null customer_id ✅
- Suggested DB query optimization – approved by team ✅
```

That's it. This setup makes me more productive and keeps me motivated. 🎯

## 2. How I Report With Confidence in Standup 🎙️

When I joined as a grad, I didn't know how the corporate world worked. I wasn't a talker (still not, but I've improved). 🤐

In standups, my updates were one-liners:

> "I wrote unit tests for the document generation function." 

And… that was it. 😬

One day, my previous leader told me:

> "You need to give us more. Standup is the only time in a busy team where people hear what you're working on. Even if you read from notes, it's fine — you'll grow into it." 📈

**This also helped me have other understanding engineers while doing this when I was reading these notes.** 🤝

That stuck with me. So I started using my **Daily Wins** to build my standup updates. I'd break it down into:

- ✅ What I worked on
- 🎯 What I achieved  
- 🚧 Any blockers
- 💡 How I solved problems

### Example update:

> "Yesterday I completed the login endpoint including unit tests, and fixed a bug in invoice generation caused by a null customer_id. The fix involved updating the database query to handle missing values. No blockers today — moving on to integrating the endpoint with the frontend." 🚀

Doing this made me sound more confident — and more useful. 💪

## 3. How I Try to Be More Visible in Meetings 👥

This one's still a work in progress for me. 🚧

Here's what I've learned so far: I speak more in meetings when I know what's going on. If I'm clueless about the topic, I prepare beforehand. 📚

If tomorrow's meeting is about "data caching strategies" and I've never touched caching, I'll Google it the night before. That way I can at least:

- ❓ Ask a relevant question
- 💡 Make a small suggestion  
- 👂 Or show I'm engaged

Sometimes all it takes is one question to start contributing more. 🗣️

## Final Thoughts 💭

These three things have helped me:

✅ Track my day in 4 sections  
✅ Use "Daily Wins" to fuel confident standup updates  
✅ Prepare for meetings so I can contribute  

If you try this and it doesn't work for you, that's fine — we're all different. But if you take away just one thing, it's this: **write stuff down**. Your brain will thank you. 🧠

Cheers. Love you. ✌️
