# Why Query Endpoints Deserve More Love in API Design

Ever opened an API spec and seen endpoints like /users, /users/\{id\}, and then suddenly /users/query — and thought, "Wait… what's this one for?"

That's your query endpoint. It's one of those things that makes perfect sense once you understand the "why," but often flies under the radar when we talk about good API design. Yet, in the right context, query endpoints can transform how your clients fetch and interact with data.

Let's unpack what they are, when to use them, and why they deserve a bit more love.

## What Are Query Endpoints?

Think of a query endpoint as a smart search bar for your API.

Instead of creating multiple routes to handle different filters — like /users/active, /users/over-30, or /users/from-cape-town — you expose one flexible endpoint that can handle dynamic queries:

```json
POST /users/query
{
  "age": ">25",
  "city": "Cape Town",
  "status": "Active"
}
```

The API then returns all users matching those filters. It's a simple concept, but it solves a big problem — it keeps your endpoint structure clean, scalable, and easy to evolve as business needs change.

## When Should You Use Query Endpoints?

Query endpoints shine when your application needs complex or dynamic filtering that can't easily be handled by traditional GET parameters.

✅ Use them when:

- You have multiple optional filters (like status, role, or createdDate).
- You need advanced capabilities like sorting, pagination, or range-based queries.
- You want to keep your API routes minimal and intuitive.

⚠️ Avoid them when:

- You only need simple lookups (e.g., /users/\{id\}).
- You can easily express filters using GET query parameters.
- The endpoint's flexibility could pose a performance or security risk if filters aren't validated properly.

## Real-World Example

Before a recent design session at my current project, I'll admit — I didn't know what a query endpoint was.

We were working on a feature for our transaction history module, and the goal was to allow clients to fetch transactions based on different criteria — date ranges, amounts, statuses, and even combinations of all three.

At first, I assumed we'd just create multiple endpoints: /transactionHistory/recent, /transactionHistory/completed, /transactionHistory/high-value, and so on. But during the design session, the team proposed something new to me — a query endpoint.

That idea completely changed how I thought about API flexibility.

Here's what we ended up building:

```json
POST /transactionHistory/query
{
  "status": "Completed",
  "minAmount": 500,
  "dateRange": ["2025-01-01", "2025-01-31"]
}
```

This single endpoint handled all our use cases — filtering by date, amount, or status — without needing separate routes. The frontend team could query any combination of filters, and the backend stayed clean and easy to maintain.

That was my "aha" moment. I finally saw how query endpoints can simplify API design while keeping it scalable for future requirements.

## How to Design a Great Query Endpoint

Here are a few best practices to keep in mind:

- **Keep it predictable.** Use a consistent request and response structure across your API.
- **Support pagination and sorting out of the box.** Your clients will thank you.
- **Validate inputs** — never trust that filters from clients are safe for direct SQL queries.
- **Document everything** — list supported filters, data types, and expected behaviors.
- **Optimize with indexes or caching** if you expect heavy querying.
